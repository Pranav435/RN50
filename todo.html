<h1>ToDo App</h1>
<p class="flow-text">In this project, you have to implement a Todo app. This is more of a website, but it should give you practice with React</p>
<h2>Specification:</h2>
<ul>
<li>The user should be able to add todos, and delete them if they like</li>
<li>The user should be able to see these todos in a list, and the app should show a count with the number of todos the user has added</li>
<h2>Getting started:</h2>
<p>Download the starter code:</p>
<a href="https://cdn.cs50.net/2019/beyond/projects/todo/todo.zip">Here</a>
<p>This should get you started, and should ensure that you only focus on the logic.</p>
<h4>What you have to do?</h4>
<p>The add-task method has already been created for you. You have to implement the delete task method, and the clear input method.</p>
<h4>Hints</h4>
<ol>
<li>To clear input, use a blank string</li>
<li>The tasks are an array, so you can just index into them.</li>
</ol>
<h2>How to submit?</h2>
<p>First, upload your files to any git repository. Next, record a 2 to 5 minute YouTube screen-cast of you showing this ToDo app. In this video, mention your name, and do a screen recording. Finally, fill out:</p>
<a href="todoSubmit.html">Fill out this form.</a>
<p>Note: The form may open your default E-Mail app. Just select your account and click send. All the info will be filled in automatically.</p>
